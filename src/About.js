        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Before transitioning into software development, I spent my previous
          career in data insights working with Fortune 500 clients to help
          inform their strategic business decisions. Upon realizing that the
          most interesting parts of my job were the analytical and technical, I
          remembered that I always had an affinity for coding - taking a couple
          Computer Science courses in college even as a humanities major just to
          itch my curiosity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knowing there was more to explore for me here, I quickly made the jump
          into software engineering and am very thankful that I did. As an
          engineer, I bring a unique blend of humanistic, data-minded and
          strategic thinking to my passion for the creative and analytical
          process of creating applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I like to write songs, work on my vocals, watch
          anime, and lift heavy things to put them down in the gym.
