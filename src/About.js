        Welcome to my page, thanks for being here! In the past couple years, I
        stumbled onto software development as my years long curiosity finally
        taking the jump to enroll in a bootcamp. My spent my years prior as a
        brand insights consultant, helping Fortune 500 companies hone their
        brand vision through data driven market research.
        <div className="About-hobbies">
          In my free time, I like to write songs, work on my vocals, and lift
          heavy things and put them down in the gym.
